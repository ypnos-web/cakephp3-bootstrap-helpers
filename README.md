Version 3.1 of the helpers is out!
==================================

A new major version **3.1** of the helpers is now out. This version brings major changes to the way helpers internally works by using
templates instead of the standard `tag()` and `div()` method.

#### Changes

- Most methods are now based on templates, meaning that:
    - Options like `tag`, `aria-*`, `data-*`, ..., have been dropped from various methods.
    - The `templateVars` options is now usable with most methods.
    - There might be escaping issue since the old `div()` and `tag()` methods did not escape content be default, while
the template based methods do. Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Holt59/cakephp3-bootstrap-helpers/issues/new) if 
you encounter problems with escaping.

Some minor changes that do not impact the user interface:
- The `BootstrapTrait` class has been split in two classes: `ClassTrait` and `EasyIconTrait`. 
- The test cases have been updated and strenghten to avoid bad modification in the code.

#### Migrating to 3.1

List of changes that need refactoring in your code:

- `BootstrapHtmlHelper`
    - The `faIcon` and `glIcon` have been dropped.
    - The `useFontAwesome` options has been dropped, the new way is to customize the `icon` template.
    - It is no longer possible to use custom `tag` to render labels, badges, alerts (still possible for `tooltip`).
- `BootstrapNavbarHelper`
    - The `autoButtonLink` options has been dropped, this was misleading for many users.

Some options such as `aria-*`, `data-*`, have been dropped from various methods since these are now included in the templates,
if you want to customize them, you should modify the template.
